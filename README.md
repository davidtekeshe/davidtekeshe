- 👋 David Tekeshe
- 👀 I am interested in replacing [Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy](https://www.stlouischildrens.org/conditions-treatments/center-for-cerebral-palsy-spasticity/about-selective-dorsal-rhizotomy) with [Neural Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_engineering). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning neural engineering
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on [LEAP](https://github.com/airwide-leap/yolanda). *At that time the lame will leap like the deer!* [Isaiah 35 vs 6a](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/isaiah/35/#v23035006)
